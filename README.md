ðŸ”§ Workshop Overview: RTL Design & Synthesis with Sky130 and Open Source Toolchains This five-day hands-on workshop by VSD focuses on RTL design and synthesis using an open-source silicon ecosystem. It employs tools like Icarus Verilog (iVerilog) for simulation, GTKWave for waveform visualization, and Yosys for synthesisâ€”all built around the SkyWater Sky130 Open Source PDK, a collaborative initiative between Google and SkyWater Technology to provide openly accessible process design resources. You can explore the full documentation here.

ðŸ’» Open Source Tools Used:

iVerilog: An open-source Verilog simulator for functional simulation of RTL code.

GTKWave: A waveform viewer for visualizing VCD (Value Change Dump) files.

Yosys: An open-source tool for synthesizing Verilog RTL into gate-level netlists.

ðŸ“š What the Workshop Covers: Participants will learn both the theory and practice of digital design using Verilog HDL, through a combination of guided lectures and lab sessions hosted on the VSD-IAT portal. Key steps include:

RTL design and implementation using Verilog

Functional simulation and stimulus-based validation

Testbench creation to verify design logic

Logic synthesis with optimization techniques using Sky130 cells
